			Archangel Stats is a small website that says how many players are searching for matchmaking live. It's
			not really a huge project or anything, but the game is fun, so I wrote something fun for it!
		</p>

		<p>
			This site uses localStorage and JQuery. All data is saved client side. The only external communication
			this app makes is to Skydance Interactive's servers for current matchmaking statistics. No personal data
			is collected when using this site.

		<h2>Websites</h2>
		<p>
			The website for this project is hosted <a href="https://redtopper.github.io/Archangel-Stats/">on GitHub pages</a>.
