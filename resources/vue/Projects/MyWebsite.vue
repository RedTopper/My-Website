			Hey, you're here right now! This is my portfolio - a collection of stuff I've done in the past. Almost
			all the projects here are open source works that are published on
			<a href="https://github.com/RedTopper">my GitHub account</a>, and that includes the source code for
			<a href="https://github.com/RedTopper/My-Website">this site itself</a> (pretty meta, huh?)

			<p>Anyway, I structured my portfolio into a few sections, described below.
		</p>
		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>
			This is the collection of projects that I have worked on in my free time. Congratulations, you're looking
			at one right now!
		</p>
		<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>
			This folder contains coursework or school-created projects. Generally these are required rather than
			inspired, but they demonstrate my ability to implement a given set of tasks.
