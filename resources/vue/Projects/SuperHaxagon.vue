			Super Haxagon is a cross platform, open source <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">Super Hexagon</a> clone for
			the Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Switch, Windows, Linux, and the
			<a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-nspire-cx-cas">TI-Nspire</a>
			(yes, the calculator). It's written with portability in mind, so it avoids using libraries and separates
			its core logic from the rendering, sound, and system pipelines via "drivers". It also has a GUI based
			level editor called <a href="https://github.com/RedTopper/Haxa-Editor">Haxa Editor</a> written in Java.

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>
			Super Haxagon started out as a hobby project for my TI-Nspire called "Super Haxaspire" in late middle
			school. At the time I considered it an interesting project in mathematics due to all of the logic it
			required, but it soon sparked my interest in programming. I still maintain this project today as a
			testing ground of skill and development.
